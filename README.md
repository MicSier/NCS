# NCS
Library for numerically solving BCS gap equation for noncentrosymmetrical 1D superconductor and finding critical temperature, heat capacity and nodal points.

# 
This was orginally part of my master thesis writen under supervision of doc. hab. Grzegorz Haran. 

# TO DO
1. mayor refactoring is in order.
2. There is a bug were sometimes max gamma is returned smaller then it should be due to incorrect way of choosing bracket points for zbrent.
